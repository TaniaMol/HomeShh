# HomeShh

**Capstone**: Programming for the Internet of Things: *Smart Home for people with different needs.*

## Planning

First, I draw a random house so I could imagine real needs for my project and the possible sensors and components I would also need in order to satisfy them, knowing that the number of the components will always be determined by the number of rooms in a house.

Next I started a prototype in Autodesk Circuits for a better aproach of what I was looking for.

Simulating the house with the wires let me keep a better understanding of the idea.

I started to wire all the RGB's using this as a guide:

And writing a table of functions, components and keys helped me to build the code.
